-- PROJECTS

-- the Yoneda lemma (also for enriched categories)
-- transporting structures along equivalences: e.g. given an equivalence of categories, transport a monoidal structure?
-- equivalences can be turned into adjoint equivalences

-- define Day convolution: the monoidal structure on FunctorCategory C D when D is monoidal.
-- is this known: a monoidal structure on monoidal functors from C to D when D is braided?

-- enriched categories!
-- closed monoidal categories
-- additive categories, additive envelopes

-- Idempotent completion as a left adjoint to the forgetful 2-functor from categories to semicategories.
