-- PROJECTS

-- equivalences can be turned into adjoint equivalences
-- Idempotent completion as a left adjoint to the forgetful 2-functor from categories to semicategories??

-- TODO move the following to the monoidal project:

-- transporting structures along equivalences: e.g. given an equivalence of categories, transport a monoidal structure?

-- define Day convolution: the monoidal structure on FunctorCategory C D when D is monoidal.
-- is this known: a monoidal structure on monoidal functors from C to D when D is braided?

-- enriched categories!
-- additive categories, additive envelopes
-- closed monoidal categories
