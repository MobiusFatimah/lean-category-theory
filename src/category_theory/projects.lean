-- PROJECTS

-- equivalences can be turned into adjoint equivalences
-- Idempotent completion as a left adjoint to the forgetful 2-functor from categories to semicategories??

-- IDEAS for Lean:
-- extract a goal as a lemma
-- on rename of Lean file, delete olean file
-- is "checking open files really working?" (e.g. can't find a trace message, even with all files open)

-- VSCode bugs:
-- "extension-output-#4" not found
-- file /settings not found
-- projects.lean.git not found

-- Questions about Lean:
-- how can we use options for new tactics?
-- how can we store state across tactic invocations? (e.g. for profiling)
-- how can trace messages show the file and line number?
